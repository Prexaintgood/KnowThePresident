                Carlos Polistico Garcia born on Nov 4, 1896 - Jun 14, 1971,
                often referred to by his initials CPG, was a Filipino teacher,
                poet, orator, lawyer, public official, political economist,
                guerrilla and Commonwealth military leader who was the eighth
                President of the Philippines. He entered politics in 1926 as a
                member of the Philippine House of Representatives and served
                until 1932. Garcia exercised the Filipino First Policy, for
                which he was known. This policy heavily favored Filipino
                businessmen over foreign investors. He was also responsible for
                changes in retail trade which greatly affected the Chinese
                businessmen in the country.

                Representatives, and headed the Constitutional Convention of
                1970. As President, Macapagal worked to suppress graft and
                corruption and to stimulate the Philippine economy. He
                introduced the country's first land reform law, placed the peso
                on the free currency exchange market, and liberalized foreign
                exchange and import controls. Many of his reforms, however, were
                crippled by a Congress dominated by the rival Nacionalista
                Party.

                15th president of the Philippines from 2010-2016. He was the son

                quality of the life of all Filipinos, particularly the poor and
                the vulnerable. Investing in the Filipino people has always been
                the cornerstone of the Aquino administration’s inclusive growth
                agenda—which is why social services continue to receive the

                goal of universal health care. The government’s mantra is clear:

                Rodrigo Duterte was born March 28, 1945. He is a Filipino
                politician who was the 16th president of the Philippines from
                2016 - 2022. The six years of the country under the Duterte
                leadership was marked by unorthodox leadership. He was focused
                on his main agenda: to improve peace and order. He traveled to
                the nooks and corners of the nation to emphasize his concern for
                these problems like a busy town mayor. His language was coarse,
                earthy, local, and sometimes unpresidential. His leadership
                style when he wanted something done was assertive and
                strong-armed. This unique style was the source of his
                charismatic appeal to the masses. It is also one that invited
                international attention, sometimes unwelcome. The most important
                aspect of his concern on peace and order was the drug problem.
                He considered it a national scourge, a source of criminality
                that should be eliminated. He took special care to emphasize
                that drug addiction destroys the person, and eventually the
                family. If he did not solve the nation’s drug problem, he
                argued, it would eventually destroy the nation. As a mayor of
                Davao, his achievements on this front was what gained him
                national attention.

                Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. was born September 13, 1957, Batac, Ilocos
                Norte, Philippines. He is a Filipino politician who has been
                president of the 17th Philippines since 2022 and is the current
                President. Prior to becoming president, he served in government
                from the 1980s to the 2010s as senator, congressman, governor,
                and vice governor. The presidential election was held on May 9,
                2022, and Bongbong was officially declared the next president on
                the 25th. He reportedly won by a landslide with more than 31
                million votes, about 58.8 percent of the total vote, the highest
                margin of victory in the country since 1981. Robredo—who had
                defeated Bongbong in the 2016 vice presidential election—placed
                second, with about 28 percent of the total vote. Having been in
                public service for over 25 years, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos
                Jr. has achieved a distinguished career in government. His
                electoral journey has allowed him to serve in several positions
                in both the executive and legislative branches of government.
                His various stints in government have allowed him to carve his
                niche in the Philippine’s rich political history.
